# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Mechanical MNIST (Cahn-Hilliard)

## Goal
This repository consists of example code for the implementation of one of the common generative model architectures: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for a material science problem. VAEs represent each datapoint as probability distribution and embeds the meaningful relations in low-dimensional latent space. These models can be used to perform inverse materials design, which means it is possible to predict structure or processing parameters for given target material properties.

In this example, VAE was implemented by using the [Mechanical MNIST (Cahn-Hilliard) Dataset](https://github.com/elejeune11/Mechanical-MNIST-Cahn-Hilliard).
This dataset consists of 2D microstructures generated by Cahn-Hilliard equation and their strain energy after finite element simulations.

By using this dataset, I aimed to (1) predict necessary phase distribution/microstructure for a given stregnth/mechanical behavior and (2) to estimate the prior and posterior microstructures of a known microstructure during phase separation.

## Methodology
When the model is trained with the dataset consisting of microstructure images of the material, the model extracts the most important features in each microstrcuture and represent these feature by its design space, which is also known as "latent space". By using the embedded information about the microstructure in this space, it is possible to predict necessary microstructures.

## Works to do
Interpolation and extrapolation in latent space will be performed.

## Additional Notes

The code was written on Google Colab platform. Different installation of libraries or functions might be required to use the notebook in local machines.
